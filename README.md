# MCMC_Oxford

During the first year of my PhD at the University of Oxford, I am taking the Advanced Simulation Methods course at the Department of Statistics as part of my broadening training. During this course I coded some of the algorithms we studied with some illustrations. I am publishing this work hoping it will help other students taking this course (or an equivalent elsewhere), I have tried to make it as interactive as possible. This must be seen as a course companion and not as a complete course on MCMC, nevertheless I will write below some of the additional readings I found useful.


**Disclaimer** I'm not teaching this course, so I could have made some mistakes, please feel free to contact me if you notice any mistakes or have any idea how to improve these notebooks.

## Metropolis-Hasting

Once you have memorised the course, follow this link to code the Metropolis-Hasting algorithm and see how it works : [Metropolis-Hasting ColabNotes](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ValentinKil/MCMC/blob/main/Metropolis-Hasting_MCMC.ipynb)(you will need a Google account).  You can find a proposed solution here :  [Metropolis-Hasting with solution](https://nbviewer.org/github/ValentinKil/MCMC/blob/main/Metropolis-Hasting_MCMCwithSol.ipynb)

## Coming soon 

I'm actually working on doing the same thing as above for Gibbs Sampling and HMC, but only a part of the code is available yet

* [Gibbs Sampling](https://nbviewer.org/github/ValentinKil/MCMC/blob/main/Gibbs_samplingwithSol.ipynb)

* [Hamiltonian Monte Carlo](https://nbviewer.org/github/ValentinKil/MCMC/blob/main/HMCwithSol.ipynb)

## Useful additional readings
